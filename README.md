Struct-DB : Efficient database management system utilizing data structures to optimize performance

Description: This project is a database management system that implements various data structures such as B-trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees for efficient data organization and storage. This system can read data and execute queries on it, providing a comprehensive solution for database management.

The use of data structures is a crucial aspect of this project, as it enables efficient data access and retrieval operations. B-trees, for example, are commonly used for indexing large datasets and can handle both range and point queries efficiently. AVL trees, on the other hand, are self-balancing and guarantee a worst-case time complexity of O(log n) for operations such as search, insert, and delete. Red-black trees are another self-balancing binary search tree that provides a balance between efficient performance and memory usage.

By leveraging these data structures, your project ensures fast and efficient query execution while maintaining data consistency and reliability. Users can perform various operations on the data, including read, write, update, and delete, with ease and speed. Furthermore, the system is designed to be scalable, enabling it to handle large amounts of data and support multiple concurrent users.

In conclusion, this project is an advanced database management system that utilizes cutting-edge data structures to provide efficient and scalable solutions for data storage and query execution. The incorporation of B-trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees ensures optimized performance, making it a reliable solution for organizations and businesses that require efficient data management.
